        Registration for the workshop is closed, as we has now reached the limit number of 80 participants. We are looking into options to see if it is possible to increase capacity and be able to re-open registration. For the moment, if you wish to still wish to attend the workshop please complete the following form below, we will send more information in due course.

    <!--
    <p>
        Please note that registration closes on Saturday 30th November and will require a payment of a £50 registration fee. If you wish to join in the social dinner there is an additional £30 fee. 
    </p>
    
   
        There is a very limited number of slots available for those that wish to give a speed-talk (10 min). If you are interested in giving one, please complete this <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/seRwB6whXt">form</a> by Thursday 31st October.
        Acceptance will be communicated shortly after, before registration closes. Priority for speed talk slots will be given to early career researchers and those that need to present in order to receive funding.
